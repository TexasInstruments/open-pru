;   File:     main.asm
;
;   Brief:    CRC example assembly file (asm) with halt instruction
;
;   Steps to build :
;
;   - Using ccs:
;             - Import pru project to ccs workspace
;             - main.asm file gets copied to ccs workspace
;             - Modify main.asm file
;             - Build the pru project, after which .out (Executable output file) and .h (Firmware header) files gets generated
;             - Either .out (Executable output file) can be loaded to PRU using ccs or R5F can write to PRU IRAM using PRUICSS driver
;   - Using makefile:
;             - Use command gmake -all to build PRU project
