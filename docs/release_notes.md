The open-pru repo does not have official software releases like the TI SDKs.

Instead, we will regularly update the open-pru repo. When the repo has
been significantly changed, we will add a new tag to the main branch.
The tag's message will include a list of updates since the previous tag.

## Viewing the release notes

To see the full release notes, use command
```
$ git tag --sort=-taggerdate -n99
```

## Checking out a specific release

To base your development on a specific tag (instead of the tip of the main
branch), checkout the tag like
```
$ git checkout -b my-branch-name tag-name
```

## Compatible SDKs

These SDK release versions can be used to build OpenPRU projects with a specific
tag. The OpenPRU projects may require modifications before they can be built
with older SDK versions. For more information, refer to
[Using Older SDKs with OpenPRU](./using_older_sdks_with_open_pru.md).

## Compatible versions of CCS & other tools

**MCU+ SDK users:**
Use the CCS version, SysConfig version, and other tool versions
listed in the MCU+ SDK "Getting Started" docs for your selected MCU+ SDK
release. See [Getting Started with MCU+ SDK](./getting_started_mcuplus.md) for
details.

**Linux SDK users:**
Use the CCS and tool versions listed in
[Getting Started with Linux SDK](./getting_started_linux.md) when the open-pru
repo is checked out to the specific release tag that you are using.
