# Linker command files for asm projects

These linker command files can be used as a starting point for PRU firmware that
is written purely in assembly. If the PRU firmware is written in mixed C and
assembly, please use the linker.cmd files under this folder instead:
source/linker_cmd/c_code.

## More information

For training on how to customize the linker.cmd file for your project, refer to
the PRU Academy.
